# Discrete Mathematics Project Tasks

This project is a comprehensive exploration of logical reasoning, digital circuit design, and cryptographic techniques using C++. It consists of four main tasks, each addressing a different aspect of computational logic and problem solving.

## Project Overview

- **Task 1: Valid and Invalid Argument**  
  Developed a C++ program that constructs truth tables for a set of premises and a conclusion. The program checks the satisfiability of the formulas and determines if the argument is valid or falsifiable.

- **Task 2: Digital Logic Circuit Simplification**  
  Designed a digital logic circuit with three inputs and basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) that drives a light bulb. The project includes computing and comparing truth tables for the original and a simplified version of the logical expression, as well as determining input values to ensure circuit satisfiability.

- **Task 3: Ciphering Using Affine Cipher**  
  Implemented an Affine Cipher in C++ that accepts an alphabet, a message, and ciphering keys to output the ciphered message.

- **Task 4: Deciphering an Affine Cipher**  
  Developed a C++ solution that reverses the ciphering process. It calculates the deciphering keys based on the provided ciphering keys and then deciphers the given message.

## Key Features

- **Algorithmic Implementation:**  
  Each task was implemented in C++ using basic math operations, emphasizing code clarity, functionality, correctness, and originality.

- **Structured Codebase:**  
  The repository follows a clear structure, with each task having its dedicated C++ file (e.g., `Task1_33.cpp`, `Task2_33.cpp`, etc.) to facilitate individual evaluation and testing.

- **Learning Outcomes:**  
  The project demonstrates proficiency in logical analysis, digital circuit simplification, and the application of classical cryptography, providing a strong foundation for further exploration in these fields.

## How to Run

1. **Compile:**  
   Use a C++ compiler to compile each task. For example:  
   ```bash
   g++ Task1_33.cpp -o task1

2. **Execute:**  
   Run the compiled executable. For example:
   ```bash
   ./task1

3. **Test:**  
   Follow the input prompts as provided in the code to test different scenarios for each task.
